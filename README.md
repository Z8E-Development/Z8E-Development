Hi, this is Z&EDev
I Make Whatever I Want To Make Whenever I Want To Make It If I No Longer Want To Then i Stop If I Dont Know How To Make Something Then I Will Just Learn How To Do It

I Like Open Source Code And Projects Because It Lets People Who Dont Want To Pay Or Refuse To Pay For Something Be Able To Use Them 
And Because If You want To Make Sure The Program/Whatever Is safe You Can Just Look And See For Your Self
Also When Projects Are Open Source It Allows For Much More Code And Components To Be Added Witch Would Not Have Happend Before


How to reach me. well why would you need to?

Iâ€™m currently learning {x86 assembly, C#}

I Know a Little Bit About { Operating Systems and Operating System Development Visual Basic JavaScript Console Apps with Gui Cosmos C# Raspberry Pi Projects }

I Know a Lot a Bit About { C#, Python, Desktop App Development Chatbots Making A Life Size Bipedal Robot Yah I Know Very specific Well Parrots And Dogs To I Guess But That Has Nothing To Do With Coding }
